This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in R programming: case-sensitive column subsetting.  When subsetting data frames, R is strictly case-sensitive.  If the names in your selection vector don't precisely match (including capitalization) the column names in the data frame, the result will be an empty data frame. This example showcases the issue and presents a solution to mitigate it.
